# Project: 美国斩杀线生存指南 (US Financial Survival Guide)

## ⭐ GUIDING RULE - Content Strategy for SEO

**Core Principle**: Create as many single-focused files as possible, organized in as many subfolders as possible within the `docs/` folder.

**Why**:
- More files = More search entry points
- More specific topics = Better SEO targeting
- Granular organization = Easier discovery

**Content Guidelines**:
- ✅ Each file should cover ONE specific topic
- ✅ Keep files relatively short and actionable (like medical-bill-checklist.md)
- ✅ Create deep folder hierarchies (e.g., docs/f1-students/work/opt/, docs/f1-students/work/cpt/)
- ✅ Cover broad topics: medical, financial, housing, working, visa status, personal safety
- ✅ DO NOT make files too long or complex
- ✅ Prioritize breadth over depth for initial content

**Topic Expansion Areas**:
1. Housing: rent negotiation, eviction defense, roommate issues, lease disputes
2. Working: employment rights, wage disputes, workplace discrimination, job search
3. F-1 Student specific: CPT, OPT, H-1B transition, work authorization, maintaining status
4. Personal safety: gun violence awareness, emergency protocols, avoiding dangerous areas
5. Immigration: visa maintenance, status changes, documentation
6. Daily life: banking, credit building, tax filing, healthcare navigation

---

## Background and Motivation

**Project Goal**: Create a comprehensive GitHub repository serving as a financial survival guide for Chinese international students in the US, covering critical topics that mainstream LLMs avoid but are essential for real-world survival.

**Target Audience**:
- Primary: Chinese international students in the US
- Secondary: All international students, Americans interested in financial defense strategies

**Core Concept**: "斩杀线" (Survival Cutoff Line) - the critical threshold where financial reserves, mental support, and survival resources drop below a point triggering irreversible cascading collapse and system "elimination"

**User's Personal Context**:
- Nearly fell below the cutoff line 2 years ago due to medical expenses
- Used GPT to negotiate medical bills down significantly
- Now financially stable with investment capacity
- Wants to help others avoid similar situations

**Content Focus Areas**:
1. Medical bill negotiation and dispute
2. Credit card rights protection and dispute resolution
3. Financial defense strategies
4. Rights protection (维权) and "battle" tactics
5. Emergency financial planning
6. Practical content that LLMs typically won't provide

---

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Challenge 1: Content Sensitivity
- Large language models avoid giving specific advice on financial disputes, negotiation tactics, and aggressive rights protection
- Need to balance being helpful vs. being legally/ethically sound
- Solution: Focus on education, documented cases, template letters, and process guides rather than specific legal advice

### Challenge 2: Bilingual SEO
- Must be searchable by both Chinese speakers (小红书, WeChat) and English speakers (Google, GitHub)
- Need proper repo structure with both languages
- **UPDATE**: User decided Chinese-only README is sufficient

### Challenge 3: Verification and Credibility
- Financial/legal information must be accurate and up-to-date
- Need to cite sources and include disclaimers
- Consider community contribution model for verification

### Challenge 4: Scope Definition
- Too broad: Becomes generic financial advice
- Too narrow: Misses critical survival scenarios
- Need to focus on "斩杀线" scenarios: emergency medical bills, debt disputes, eviction defense, employment issues

### 2025-01-29 - Initial Repository Setup Complete

**Completed Milestone**: Repository foundation has been successfully established.

### 2025-01-29 - Content Creation Phase: 32 Files Created for SEO

- Organized in deep folder hierarchies
- Each file covers ONE specific topic
- Kept files relatively short and actionable
- Prioritized breadth over depth for SEO

## Lessons Learned

### Project-Specific Lessons:
1. **Research shows gap in market**: No comprehensive Chinese-language financial survival guide for US students exists on GitHub (as of 2025-01-29 search)
2. **Medical bill negotiation is viable**: Multiple sources confirm 30-50% reduction possible with negotiation
3. **Credit card payment is trap**: Should NOT pay medical bills with credit cards (lose negotiation leverage, incur interest)
4. **Dollar For and CFPB are key resources**: These organizations provide free templates and guidance

### Technical Lessons:
1. **UTF-8 encoding critical for Chinese content**: Files created via Write tool initially showed binary encoding, requiring recreation to ensure proper UTF-8 handling
2. **File encoding verification**: Use `file -I filename` to check encoding before committing bilingual content
3. **Docsify is perfect for no-build documentation**: No npm dependencies, no build process, no CI/CD needed - just HTML + Markdown
4. **Client-side rendering works great for docs**: Docsify loads markdown files in the browser, making deployment trivial
5. **GitHub Pages with /docs folder**: Setting source to /docs folder keeps main repo clean and separates source from site files

---

## Notes & References

### Research Sources:
- Dollar For: Medical bill negotiation and charity care resources
- Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: Dispute templates and guidance
- NPR Life Kit: Medical bill negotiation strategies
- Multiple sources confirm lack of comprehensive guides targeting Chinese students specifically

### User Requirements:
- Must be Chinese-only (user decided against bilingual)
- Must cover content LLMs typically avoid
- Must be practical and actionable
- Must include 维权 (rights protection) strategies
- Must be searchable by both Chinese and American audiences (via keywords/tags)
- License: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
