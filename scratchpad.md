# Project: 美国斩杀线生存指南 (US Financial Survival Guide)

## Background and Motivation

**Project Goal**: Create a comprehensive GitHub repository serving as a financial survival guide for Chinese international students in the US, covering critical topics that mainstream LLMs avoid but are essential for real-world survival.

**Target Audience**:
- Primary: Chinese international students in the US
- Secondary: All international students, Americans interested in financial defense strategies

**Core Concept**: "斩杀线" (Survival Cutoff Line) - the critical threshold where financial reserves, mental support, and survival resources drop below a point triggering irreversible cascading collapse and system "elimination"

**User's Personal Context**:
- Nearly fell below the cutoff line 2 years ago due to medical expenses
- Used GPT to negotiate medical bills down significantly
- Now financially stable with investment capacity
- Wants to help others avoid similar situations

**Content Focus Areas**:
1. Medical bill negotiation and dispute
2. Credit card rights protection and dispute resolution
3. Financial defense strategies
4. Rights protection (维权) and "battle" tactics
5. Emergency financial planning
6. Practical content that LLMs typically won't provide

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Challenge 1: Content Sensitivity
- Large language models avoid giving specific advice on financial disputes, negotiation tactics, and aggressive rights protection
- Need to balance being helpful vs. being legally/ethically sound
- Solution: Focus on education, documented cases, template letters, and process guides rather than specific legal advice

### Challenge 2: Bilingual SEO
- Must be searchable by both Chinese speakers (小红书, WeChat) and English speakers (Google, GitHub)
- Need proper repo structure with both languages
- **UPDATE**: User decided Chinese-only README is sufficient

### Challenge 3: Verification and Credibility
- Financial/legal information must be accurate and up-to-date
- Need to cite sources and include disclaimers
- Consider community contribution model for verification

### Challenge 4: Scope Definition
- Too broad: Becomes generic financial advice
- Too narrow: Misses critical survival scenarios
- Need to focus on "斩杀线" scenarios: emergency medical bills, debt disputes, eviction defense, employment issues

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### 2025-01-29 - UTF-8 Encoding Fixed

**Issue Identified**: Both README.md and scratchpad.md had binary encoding issues causing Chinese characters to display as garbled text.

**Resolution**:
- Removed corrupted files
- Recreated README.md with proper UTF-8 encoding
- Recreated scratchpad.md with proper UTF-8 encoding

**Verification**:
```bash
file -I README.md scratchpad.md
```

**Current Status**:
All foundational files are ready with proper encoding:
- LICENSE (UTF-8)
- README.md (UTF-8, Chinese)
- .gitignore (ASCII)
- scratchpad.md (UTF-8, mixed English/Chinese)

**Awaiting**: User approval to make initial git commit

### 2025-01-29 - Initial Repository Setup Complete

**Completed Milestone**: Repository foundation has been successfully established.

**Repository Structure**:
```
US-Financial-Survival-Guide/
├── .git/
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)
├── README.md (Chinese)
├── scratchpad.md (project planning document)
├── docs/
│   ├── medical-bills/
│   ├── credit-cards/
│   ├── emergency-finance/
│   ├── rights-protection/
│   └── case-studies/
├── guides/
├── templates/
└── resources/
```

**Questions for User**:
1. Should I proceed with the initial git commit now that encoding is fixed?
2. Would you like to review the files before committing?
3. Should we move to content development next, or switch to [Planner] mode for detailed content strategy?

**Waiting for**: User input on next steps

## Lessons Learned

### Project-Specific Lessons:
1. **Research shows gap in market**: No comprehensive Chinese-language financial survival guide for US students exists on GitHub (as of 2025-01-29 search)
2. **Medical bill negotiation is viable**: Multiple sources confirm 30-50% reduction possible with negotiation
3. **Credit card payment is trap**: Should NOT pay medical bills with credit cards (lose negotiation leverage, incur interest)
4. **Dollar For and CFPB are key resources**: These organizations provide free templates and guidance

### Technical Lessons:
1. **UTF-8 encoding critical for Chinese content**: Files created via Write tool initially showed binary encoding, requiring recreation to ensure proper UTF-8 handling
2. **File encoding verification**: Use `file -I filename` to check encoding before committing bilingual content
